# Python Wordle

Command line version of the game Wordle.

The objective of the game is to guess a randomly picked 5 letter word. More detailed instructions are available in the main menu of the program.

The program has one library not included with base Python: Termcolor which you can install using ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

Only tested on Windows command line, colored text probably won't work on other OSes and the file might just fail to run entirely.

Run using ``` python wordle.py ```
